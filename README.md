# RINA

## Description:
RINA is an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) project. It is written in python, used OpenCV and Thread libraries. With threading we can control motors and camera in syncronization. Project is under progress and that is not final form of code.

## How To Use:
If you need to detect Rectangle Shapes then start the code with argument ```1```

If you need to detect Circle Shapes then start the code with argument ```2```

In both case you should set trackbars to detect shapes properly
